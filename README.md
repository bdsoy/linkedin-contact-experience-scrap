### linkedin-contact-experience-scrap

Scraping contacts' current company from job history in LinkedIn. 
Backgroud/reason for doing this is: everytime when we send newsletters/emails via hubspots to our contacts, there are around 40 soft bounced contacts. The emails were bounced most likely due to the fact that the contact has changed company, and therefore their old email does not work any more. We used to search from LinkedIN manually for each person, but we would like to try to do it a "smarter" way if possible.

### linkedin-competitor posts scrape and post to Power BI dashboard

Scraping LinkedIn posts from competitor and visualize in Power BI
Background/reason is we don't want to manually check our competitors' situation! We want to do it a smarter way.
