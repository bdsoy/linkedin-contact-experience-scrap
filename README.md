# linkedin-contact-experience-scrap

I am working on scraping contacts' current company from job history in LinkedIn. Backgroud/reason for doing this is: everytime when we send newsletters/emails via hubspots to our contacts, there are around 40 soft bounced contacts. The emails were bounced most likely due to the fact that the contact has changed company, and therefore their old email does not work any more. We used to search from LinkedIN manually for each person, but we would like to try to do it a "smarter" way if possible.
What I need help with is that I found out that the format is not working with every contacts, i.e.: soup.find('section',{'id':'experience-section'}) works with most of contacts, but for some, they show "None" (I have used "inspection" from chrome to check the right field to scrape).
